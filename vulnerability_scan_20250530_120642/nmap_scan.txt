|   Slowloris DOS attack
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

|   VULNERABLE:
|   Webmin File Disclosure
|     State: VULNERABLE (Exploitable)
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2006-3392
|       Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML.
|       This allows arbitrary files to be read, without requiring authentication, using "..%01" sequences
|       to bypass the removal of "../" directory traversal sequences.
